**Call of Duty Zombies Map Roulette**  
Quick Note:  
There are so many zombies maps now, it can be hard to decide which one you want to play. This application allows you to choose any Treyarch game featuring round-based maps to get a random map from that game, or if you do not have a preference you can choose to get a random map from all games.

This desktop app was developed in Python starting in the summer of 2024\.
